A bundled package of the Jerry Controller and the Jerry Server developed by Jackson Wilson with the help of Cole Bahan. The Jerry Server is meant to be placed onto a Raspberry Pi with an Arduino with 2 Vex servo motors attached. The Jerry Bundle was developed completely in Java. The Jerry Controller uses SSH with the JSch library, while the Jerry Server uses serial communication with the Jssc library.
